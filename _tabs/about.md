Hi, I'm Achmad — a software developer who loves building modern Android apps with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I’ve spent a lot of time working with tools like Dagger Hilt, Koin, Retrofit, and other Jetpack libraries. I’ve also dabbled a bit in backend development with Spring Boot and Ktor, and I enjoy setting up deployments and networking in my homelab using Docker (including this blog).

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech, reading mangas, playing video games, tinkering with home servers, or just building tools I found useful from scratch (just because).
